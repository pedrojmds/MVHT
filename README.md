# MVHT
Manual Validation Helper Tool

MVHT is a web tool designed to help semantic similarity measure developers create gold-standards of manual similarity values and can be accessed in http://mvht.lasige.di.fc.ul.pt/index.php.__
Datasets containing entities can be inserted into the tool as long as they respect a certain JSON format. To see a description of the format please visit http://mvht.lasige.di.fc.ul.pt/format.html.__
After inserting a dataset users can share a link with curators so that they can quickly start making comparisons between pairs of entities anytime, anywhere and the tool stores those answers and gives dataset owners the option to download those results.__
3 datasets representing distinct entities can be found here. Data for each dataset was taken from:__
  -KEGG PATHWAY__
  -BioModels__
  -CRAFT annotated papers__
